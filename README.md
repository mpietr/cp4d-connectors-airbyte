# cp4d-connectors-airbyte
With IBMÂ® Cloud Pak for Data, you can connect to different data sources. There are several data source types supported out of the box. In addition for data source types not supported out-of-the-box there is an option to extend them with custom connectors. This project contains proof of concept of integrating CPD connectivity with Airbyte connectors.

A project is a part of the master thesis at Poznan University of Technology, done in collaboration with IBM Polska Sp. z o. o.

## AirbyteAssetParser

***AirbyteAssetParser*** is a Java class in the `pl.poznan.put.connect.airbyte` package. 

It parses assets using their path and namespace.

### Methods

#### `parseAssets(...)`
A static method, wrapper method for retriving assets. 
Calls either getNamespacedAsset or getAssetWithoutNamespace to retrieve the appropriate assets<br>
- parameters:
    - `String path`
    - `List<CustomFlightAssetDescriptor> assets`
- returns:  
    - `List<CustomFlightAssetDescriptor>`
    
Method is used to parse a list of assets and return a subset of those assets based on the provided path and whether the assets belong to a namespace or not.
    
---

#### `getNamespacedAsset(...)` 
A static method, retrieves namespaced assets.

This method is used to retrieve a specific set of assets based on a provided path and matchers in a context where assets are organized by namespaces and possibly further categorized into streams.<br>
- parameters:
    - `Matcher namespaceMatcher` 
    - `Matcher streamMatcher` 
    - `List<CustomFlightAssetDescriptor> assets` 
    - `String path`

    - `List<CustomFlightAssetDescriptor>` objects based on the provided parameters
- exeptions:
    - `IllegalArgumentException`


It returns the original list of assets if the path is empty, transforms the list into CustomFlightAssetDescriptor objects if the path is a single forward slash, filters and transforms the list based on the matchers if they match, and throws an *IllegalArgumentException* if none of these conditions are met.

---

#### `getAssetWithoutNamespace(...)`
A static method, retrieves assets without a namespace.<br><br>
- parameters:

## AirbyteSourceInteraction

Implements `RowBasedSourceInteraction` class and is part of the `pl.poznan.put.connect.airbyte` package. 

This class is used to represent an interaction with a source in the Airbyte connector and provides methods to get records from the source.

### Constructors

- `AirbyteSourceInteraction( AirbyteConnector connector, CustomFlightAssetDescriptor asset, List<CustomFlightAssetDescriptor> descriptors)`

This constructor initializes the `AirbyteSourceInteraction` with the given connector, asset, and descriptors.

- `AirbyteSourceInteraction( AirbyteConnector connector, CustomFlightAssetDescriptor asset, Process podProcess)`

This constructor initializes the `AirbyteSourceInteraction` with the given connector, asset, and process. Additionaly, it sets up the `reader` to read the output from the process.

### Methods

#### `getRecord()`
Processes the read action using the [AirbyteStreamProcessor](#airbytestreamprocessor).[processReadAction](#processreadaction) method and returns the resulting *Record*.
- returns:
    - `Record`
- exeptions:
    - `IOException`
    - `RuntimeException`

---

#### `getFields()`
The method first checks if the fields of the current asset are `null`. If they are, it retrieves the *stream_name* and *namespace* from the asset's interaction properties. Than, it searches through a list of `CustomFlightAssetDescriptor`, looking for a first matchibg descriptor and creates a new `DiscoveredAssetDetails` object, sets it as the details of the asset, and adds the `configuredCatalog` from the descriptor to the asset's details.
- returns:
    - `List<CustomFlightAssetField>`
- exception:
    - `IllegalArgumentException`

---

#### `close()`
Closes *AirbyteSourceInteraction*.
- exeptions:

## AirbyteStreamProcessor

Used to process custom, discover and read actions in Airbyte. 

Processing is done by reading lines from a `BufferedReader`, parsing them into [AirbyteMessage]() (subdirectory models) objects, and handling them based on their type.

### Methods

#### `processCustomAction(...)`
This method processes a custom action by processing data from the *BufferedReader* and handling them based on their type. It returns a *HashMap* with the processed response.
- parameters: 
    - `BufferedReader bufferedReader`
- returns:
    - `HashMap<String,Object>`
- exceptions: 
    - `IOException`

---

#### `processDiscoverAction(...)`
This method processes a discover action by processing data from the *BufferedReader* and handling them based on their type. It returns a list of `CustomFlightAssetDescriptor` objects representing the discovered assets.
- parameters: 
    - `BufferedReader bufferedReader`
- returns:
    - `List<CustomFlightAssetDescriptor>`
- exceptions: 
    - `IOException`

---

#### `processReadAction()`
The method starts by reading `BufferedReader`. For each line read, the method logs a debug message indicating the content of the line and, using the `gson` library, parses the line into an `AirbyteMessage` object.
Based on message's type it creates a new `Record` object and populates it with values from the message and returning the object.

If the method finishes reading all lines in the buffer without returning a `Record`, it returns *null*. This could indicate that no record was found in the stream, or that all records encountered were of type **TRACE** with trace type **ERROR**, or of type **CONNECTION_STATUS** with status **FAILED**.

- parameters: 
    - `BufferedReader bufferedReader`
    - `List<CustomFlightAssetField> fields`
- returns:
    - `Record`
- exeptions:
    - `IOException`

 Currently, it returns `null`.
- returns:
    - `CustomFlightAssetDescriptor`

## schema

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `JsonSchema` | This class represents a JSON schema, which is a tool for validating the structure of JSON data. It has several fields including `$schema`, `title`, `description`, `type`, `properties`, and `required`. The `@Data` annotation from Lombok library is used to automatically generate boilerplate code like getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods. |
| `JsonSchemaProperty` | This class represents a property within a JSON schema. It has fields like `description`, `type`, `format`, and `airbyteType`. The `type` field can be any object, representing the flexibility of types a JSON property can have. The `airbyteType` field is annotated with `@SerializedName("airbyte_type")`, indicating that in JSON, this field will be named as "airbyte_type". |
| `JsonSchemaTypes` | This is an enumeration that defines the possible types a JSON schema property can have. It includes `INTEGER`, `STRING`, `NUMBER`, `BOOLEAN`, `ARRAY`, and `OBJECT`. Each enum value is annotated with `@SerializedName`, which indicates the actual JSON property name when the enum is serialized or deserialized with Gson. |

<!-- | Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `JsonSchema` | Represents a JSON schema with fields for schema details and properties, and uses Lombok's `@Data` for boilerplate code. |
| `JsonSchemaProperty` | Represents a property in a JSON schema with fields for property details and type flexibility. |
| `JsonSchemaTypes` | Defines possible types a JSON schema property can have, with each type represented as an enum value. | -->
