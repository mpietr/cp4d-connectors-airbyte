# cp4d-connectors-airbyte
With IBM® Cloud Pak for Data, you can connect to different data sources. There are several data source types supported out of the box. In addition for data source types not supported out-of-the-box there is an option to extend them with custom connectors. This project goal is to integrate CPD connectivity with Airbyte connectors.
